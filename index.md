### What I did:
* fixed the spacing of the header title (commented out Slate title formatting in default.html, added Notepad title formatting back)
* fixed some formatting (mostly whitespace) in default.html to make more readable
* changed color of nav links and subtitle in stylesheet
* added a small, plain, lavenderish square named logo.png to /assets/images and made sure the src path for logo was correct in default.html (site now has placeholder logo!!! placement is weird but it's there!!)

### TODO:
- [x] change color of nav links (can barely see them!)
- [x] change color of subtitle/description in header
- [x] add placeholder logo
