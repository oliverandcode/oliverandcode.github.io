Hi, my name is Oliver Ayers, and this is my professional website! Here you can find my coding blog/dev diary, my projects, and my contact information. 

###### About me:
I am a freelance software developer in the San Diego area. For a few years I was a self-taught coder, and then in 2017/2018 I had the wonderful opportunity to get a really excellent compsci education through the LaunchCode program in St. Louis, Missouri!
