### About me:
I am a freelance software developer in the San Diego area. For a few years I was a self-taught coder, and then in 2017/2018 I had the wonderful opportunity to get a really excellent compsci education through the LaunchCode program in St. Louis, Missouri! Now I am freelancing and building a portfolio of personal projects, found [here]({{site.url}}/projects).
