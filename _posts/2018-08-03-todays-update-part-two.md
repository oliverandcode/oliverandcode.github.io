### What I did:
* moved updates to _posts directory
* added some defaults in _config
* made blog link work! now displays a (badly formatted) list of links to posts!

### TODO:
- [x] how do you access _posts??? figure that out
- [x] create blog.md (or blog.html?) and format it (see hmfaysal/Notepad/featured.html) IN A NEW GIT BRANCH THO
- [x] delete post text from index
- [ ] replace index.md text with something??? ideas: 
    - most recent blog post(s)
    - contact info
    - welcome blurb
- [ ] make projects link go somewhere
