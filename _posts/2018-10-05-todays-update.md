### What I did:
- Made flexible bylines for STG (uses 'voices' key-value pair in the YAML front matter). I learned a lot about Liquid tags in the process. 
- Organized some of the STG metadata defaults in _config, in preparation for creating an RSS feed

### TODO:
- [ ] generate RSS feed for podcast site - probably need to buy domain name first, but let's see
- [ ] new project idea: make a template podcast site, in case I do another podcast, or want to make a website for someone else's podcast
- [ ] small todo: add favicon (make favicon)
