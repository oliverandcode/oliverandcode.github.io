### What I did:
- Changed background color of menu on this site because it was bothering me that I couldn't really read the links unless I hovered over them.
- Fixed an error in the "date" metadata of a couple of blog posts. (There were three zeros in the minutes spot for some reason?)

### TODO:
- [ ] generate RSS feed for podcast site - probably need to buy domain name first, but let's see
- [ ] new project idea: make a template podcast site, in case I do another podcast, or want to make a website for someone else's podcast
