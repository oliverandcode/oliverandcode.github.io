### What I did:
- Changed background color of menu on this site because it was bothering me that I couldn't really read the links unless I hovered over them.
- Fixed an error in the "date" metadata of a couple of blog posts. (There were three zeros in the minutes spot for some reason?)
- Uploaded STG site images to www.survivorteamgo.com bucket on S3 and hooked up the links - works! Just a header image and an about page image for now (different sizes of the same logo)
    - [x] small todo: add favicon (make favicon)
- Fixed latest STG episode page audio link (twice! ugh)

### TODO:
- [x] generate RSS feed for podcast site - probably need to buy domain name first, but let's see
- [x] new project idea: make a template podcast site, in case I do another podcast, or want to make a website for someone else's podcast
