### What I did:
* made page header link back to home
* added site.links in _config
* added nav bar in default.html (thanks to hmfaysal/Notepad)
* added css for nav bar in style.css (thanks to hmfaysal/Notepad - lines 40 thru 213 on his stylesheet)

### TODO:
- [ ] make and upload a logo (check what size is used and where file is located in Notepad)
- [x] fix how the header displays
- [ ] make blog, projects, about links go somewhere
- [x] put these updates into _posts
