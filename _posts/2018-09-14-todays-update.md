I linked up all 8 episodes of STG to individual episode pages on the STG website! They're hosted on an S3 bucket called episodes.survivorteamgo.com and someday I'll register the domain name and figure out how to log access requests and generate an RSS feed for iTunes! Next problem to attack: making the website function on mobile. Because it doesn't. You click the link to the episodes list and there's an error. :(

### TODO:
- [x] make STG work for mobile
- [ ] generate RSS feed
- [ ] move repetitive episode metadata to defaults in _config
