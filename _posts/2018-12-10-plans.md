I have a few projects in planning stages, mostly websites: professional websites for a couple of artist friends of mine, a website for a religion/performance piece I'm part of, a podcast website template (backburner for now), and further developments for the two websites I already maintain (this one and the podcast website).

### Bailey Davenport, painter and performance artist:

Minimum requirements:
- [ ] about/contact page, with photo, artist bio, email address, and relevant links
- [ ] gallery of images (mostly photos of paintings, I think) and videos
    - have already begun looking up ways to do this - looks like learning jQuery is a good idea
- [ ] possibly a contact form

### Ernest Churchill, composer and musician:

Minimum requirements:
- [ ] about/contact page, with photo, artist bio, email address, and relevant links
- [ ] if he goes the YouTube route, a link to his YouTube channel and possibly an embedded YouTube feed?
- [ ] if he does a podcast instead, S3 buckets for audio hosting, itunes compatible rss feed, etc
- [ ] blog with embedded videos (how can I make this easy for him to update without emailing me? I guess he could have his own repo? he has some programming experience, so that would probably work)
- [ ] possibly a contact form

### The Fellowship of the Incarnate Divine:

Brainstorming because this one is weird:
- landing page with a hi def photo of cows (probably) and the message "Welcome, Sisters" in large font across the image
- anywhere you click on the home page leads to the Archive?
- Archive is a gallery of images - pdfs like Diary of a Girl, photos and videos of performances - and perhaps also a blog-like list of testimonies and truths

##### Research:
[JW.org](https://www.jw.org) has Who Are We? and a little explanation on their homepage, plus links to their publications, the text of the actual bible (plus translations etc), news, a more detailed "about" page, a search bar, and user login functionality (what purpose does that serve for their website??). Other links too at the bottom, but that's the main stuff.

[SRF's website](https://www.yogananda-srf.org) has a photo of the temple in Encinitas and a picture (colorized b&w photo?? realistic illustration??) of founder Paramahansa Yogananda. Links at the top: Paramahansa Yogananda, About SRF, Meditation & Kriya Yoga, Spiritual Living, Centers & Programs, News, and Bookstore - most with their own nested dropdown menus, so that's a lot already. Then there's a small news feed with 3 recent items and a link to the rest, a "Learn to Meditate" image and link with a quote from PY, and a small events feed with 3 recent events and a link to the calendar. Four more image links below those! Intense website. Lots of content. We don't have that much for the fellowship at this point. But we could do "Origins" and have a description of Gopvindava revealing herself to Sister Sramava. We could have a prophet page, with a list of known prophets, their prophet names, and the holy missions they have set out upon. We also have saints! We probably need a page explaining Truth Acceptance too. Radical Acceptance.

[Unarius](https://www.unarius.org/) top menu: Home, Store, Events & Classes, Contact Us, Site Map, Blog, Donate, Free Resources. Then a strip of image (space, planets, symbols, etc) with the name superimposed. Then a side menu (Spiritual and Psychic Growth, Unarius Television Programs, Tesla and Free Energy, Discover Your Past Lives, Extraterrestrial Intelligence, Unarius Espanol, View More Topics), a welcome blurb, some testimonies, "What's new," link to blog, email list, link to livestreamed classes, "Founders of Unarius," YouTube channel link, virtual tour. A lot! Some of it looks like it's redundant - like, the same content with multiple links to make it seem like they have more than they do, but A) I could be wrong about that and B) even if the *kinds* of content they produce are limited, the *quantity* is frankly overwhelming. So many past life reenactments. So many psychodramas. It's truly astonishing.

### Survivor Team Go, a podcast for survivors of trauma:

Next steps:
- [ ] contact form!!!!
- [ ] LOTS of css modifications, it needs to be A) legible and easy on the eyes and B) reasonably attractive and eye-catching (pink!!!)
- [ ] write bios for me and Bailey (I have been avoiding this for so long, I hate writing bios)
- [ ] episode specific links and explanations - I really want a place to discuss/explain the concepts of Survivor Allies/Allyship, Survivor Communities and solidarity, and our podcast's priorities (elevating the stories of actual Survivors, curating a "library of trauma," being Specific, exploring ambiguity but remaining faithful to our priority of Believing Survivors, constructing a narrative of heroism and resilience as opposed to victimhood and fragility - even though survivors are often heroes as well as victims, resilient as well as fragile - there's also the pro-disclosure stance, which is not the same as pressuring or forcing any individual survivor to disclose, and the opposition to the culture of silence)
