### What I did:
* deleted updates from index.md
* made about page (incl. adding pic to /assets/images)
* made projects pages (just says "coming soon!")

### TODO:
- [x] make projects link go somewhere (branch: projects)
- [x] make contact/about page (branch: about)
- [ ] put contact info in footer (new branch: footer)
- [x] fix about page image (branch: about? is this an issue with the link though? idk if the way i linked it can work when running locally ... maybe i should make it a relative link instead?)
- [x] fix blog post list formatting (branch: blog)
