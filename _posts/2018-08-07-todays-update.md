So, the mobile menu still does not work - but there is a tiny almost unnoticeable rectangle in the upper right corner. The changes I made did SOMETHING. I think my next strategy is going to be to compartmentalize the css files a little more similarly to how they were on hmfaysal/Notepad, where I got all the styling for the menu from.

Also, I'm starting another website! It'll be a website for the podcast I do with my friend, Survivor Team Go. Do I want to start with a fork to make things easier on myself?? What elements do I need? Obviously there has to be a homepage with an embedded audio player. I don't know that a blog is necessary, but a blog setup is similar to what I want in terms of posting each episode, with descriptions and tags and audio files. Has anyone else created a podcast website using GH Pages? Do I even want to use GH Pages for this? Research is needed.

### What I did:
- nothing yet

### TODO:
- [ ] reorganize css to see if that helps the mobile menu problem (branch: mobile-menu)
- [ ]
