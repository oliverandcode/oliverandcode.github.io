### What I did:
- added several includes! head, header, footer - and navbar, which is included in header, just to make things a little more readable. Everything is much more beautiful! I am much calmer looking at layouts etc.
- made header title link to root url instead of current url (did this in the "includes" branch, shrug)

### TODO:
- [x] improve code formatting, use _includes: head, header, footer, etc (branch: includes)
- [ ] make menu display on mobile (new branch: mobilemenu)
- [ ] put contact/social media in footer (new branch: footer)
- [ ] make "next" and "previous" buttons for blog posts (branch: blog)
- [x] make header title link to root url not current url (new branch? header?)
- [ ] improve readability of blog page list (branch: blog)
- [ ] figure out why favicon isn't showing up (branch: logo)
- [ ] decide what to put on the home page
- [ ] make blog page title "blog" again and just put "Dear Dev Diary..." in a h# element (branch: blog)
