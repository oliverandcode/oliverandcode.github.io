I may have been going about fixing the mobile menu in the wrong way. I haven't understood much of the css I've added to try to fix it, but I thought that surely if I just copy what someone else has done, someone whose code already works, it'll work for me too, and it'll be faster than trying to really figure out how to do it myself. Isn't that what programmers do all the time? Borrow and expand on code written by other people?

However, this approach has not been very successful. I need to do some learning.
